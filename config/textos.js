const DESCRICAO_01 = `🆘 Max needs you now. His pain is daily — and hope depends on your empathy.
Max was the victim of an indescribable cruelty. Humans put lit fireworks inside his mouth. The explosion destroyed everything. He completely lost his lower jaw — a vital structure that every living being needs to eat, drink, chew, defend themselves, and even breathe normally.

Today, Max survives in constant agony. His mouth remains open, bleeding, unprotected, with no relief. He cannot feed himself. The pain is silent, yet daily. He doesn’t cry — because he can’t even do that. He just waits…

But there is a chance. A real chance to restore dignity and life to Max.`

🧬 What is a jaw prosthesis?
The jaw is the bone that supports the entire lower part of the face. When it is lost, the animal also loses:

- The ability to chew or lick
- Tongue control
- Protection of the oral cavity
- The possibility of living without chronic pain

The lower jaw prosthesis is a custom surgical structure, made of biocompatible material, that replaces the lost bone and restores basic mouth functionality. Without it, Max has no future.

🏥 How much does it cost to give Max this chance?
The costs are high because this case is extremely rare, delicate, and high-risk:

✅ Custom prosthesis: $1,800 to $2,400  
✅ Reconstructive surgery: $3,000 to $4,000  
✅ Post-operative care: $1,000 (medications, hospital stays, physical therapy)  
✅ Adaptation and additional tests: $600  
📍Estimated total: $6,400 to $8,000

This amount can save a life — Max’s life. A life that has already suffered everything imaginable… yet still trusts us.
